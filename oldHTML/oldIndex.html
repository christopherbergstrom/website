					I immediately jumped into learning by using free online resources like Codecademy, and started off learning HTML and Ruby.

					After searching high and low for the best web development bootcamps in America, I decided on Skill Distillery.
					After being accepted into the program, I moved my wife and I from CA to CO.
					Skill Distillery is an intensive 19 week bootcamp, and so far, the only coding bootcamp to teach Java for the back end side of web development.
					Skill Distillery also focuses on teaching JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.
					During the program, I gained a ton of experience working in groups, pair programming and programming on my own.
					I created many programs and web apps from scratch.
					The best of which are hosted on this website, in my <a class="link" href = "portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.
