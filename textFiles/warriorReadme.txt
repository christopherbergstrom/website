<p>This is a remake of my rpg warrior project command line Java game, using object oriented programming with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery</p>
When I originally made this game using Java in December of 2016, I was very new to programming, didn't quite understand object oriented programming and had tons of repeat code.
This updated version has 6% of the lines of code in just the fight class alone compared to the original version.
The remake of this project has been long overdue and I feel it really demonstrates my ability to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery effectively.<br><br>
