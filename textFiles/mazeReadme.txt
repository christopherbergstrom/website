<p>This is a game that makes you a new maze every time you play, no two times are the same!</p>
The game keeps track of the maze walls using a multidimensional array which is an X, Y plane
representation of the maze. It also uses a regular array to keep track of possible paths during
the building of the maze which it then backtracks through once it has reached a dead end ensuring that
all possible paths are taken.<br><br>
