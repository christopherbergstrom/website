Hi, I'm Chris and I love programming. I discovered web development in 2015 and it's been a part of my
life ever since.<br><br>
Since then I have been on a wild journey that included moving from California to Colorado to attend
 a 6 month long full stack web development bootcamp
called <a href='http://skilldistillery.com/' class='link' target='_blank'>Skill Distillery</a>,
finishing the program but not being able to find a job, moving back to California to go back to
my old job as a mail carrier, and now finally rediscovering my love for programming.<br><br>
I believe that you are only limited by your imagination and that anything is possible if you
believe in yourself and are willing to put in the work.<br><br>
I am more determined now than I ever have been before to have a career in web development and
fulfill my dreams of being a professional web developer.<br><br>
To sum it all up, I am a hardworking, likable guy, who is easy to get along with, loves
solving problems and learning new things.<br><br>In my free time I enjoy updating my website,
making HTML games, riding my motorcycle, and going to the gym.
